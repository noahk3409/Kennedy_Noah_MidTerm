      <h1>Xbox Vs. Playstation</h1>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>Xbox Series X</h2>
        <p> 
          Xbox Series X is the supreme console gaming experience. It has up to 8k support, an 8-core 3.8 GHz CPU, up to a 1TB SSD, <br>
             and can run games at a staggering 120fps. The specs aren't the only thing that are powerful though, as this powerhouse has game titles <br>
             that have been a staple in gaming since the dawn of the Xbox console series. Popular franchises that can be found on Xbox include <br>
             the Halo series, Forza Motorsport and Forza Horizon, Gears of War, and Microsoft Flight Simulator just to name a few. <br> <br>
             That isn't all the system has to offer though, as the Xbox console is rich with third-party game titles to play on top of the <br>
             already established first party titles. Which brings me to another benefit of this system, Microsoft provides you with Xbox Game Pass; <br>
             a service that gives you access to a massive rotating catalog of games from a variety of publishers, as well as Xbox Live Gold and EA Play <br>
             services included in your single subscription, that for the first month, you can start right now for only $1.

        <h2>Playstation 5</h2>
          <p>
            The Playstation 5 outclasses the Xbox Series X in numerous aspects and for that reason, it is the premium way to play video games on console. <br>
            It also has 8k support, up to 1TB SSD, and despite the shortcomings on the CPU, it is still more than powerful enough to play any game you want <br>
            and give you that beautifully crisp 120fps. Although the power is still impressive on PS5, that isn't Sony's main focus for the console. <br> <br>
            That is where the games come into play. The amount of amazing first party titles on this system are truly impressive. To name a few, <br>
            the Playstation console is home to well beloved series and games such as The Last Of Us, God of War, Horizon Zero Dawn, Uncharted, Bloodborne, <br>
            Infamous, Spider-Man, and so, so, so many more incredible gaming experiences. And Playstation also has the benefit of PS Plus, a service that <br>
            competes very well with Xbox's Game Pass. Playstation Plus gives you access to just as wide of a variety in its games library, and it has a <br>
            service known as Playstation Now, which allows you to stream games to your system and play games from any of the systems that came before the PS5. <br>
            this also allows you to stream to your phone, TV, desktop computer, or laptop to play games on the go, all included in a singular subscription.
